#### 39.5.4 Delayed Warnings

Sometimes, you may wish to avoid showing a warning while a command is running, and only show it only after the end of the command. You can use the function `delay-warning` for this.

*   Function: **delay-warning** *type message \&optional level buffer-name*

    This function is the delayed counterpart to `display-warning` (see [Warning Basics](Warning-Basics.html)), and it is called with the same arguments. The warning message is queued into `delayed-warnings-list`.

<!---->

*   Variable: **delayed-warnings-list**

    The value of this variable is a list of warnings to be displayed after the current command has finished. Each element must be a list

        (type message [level [buffer-name]])

    with the same form, and the same meanings, as the argument list of `display-warning`. Immediately after running `post-command-hook` (see [Command Overview](Command-Overview.html)), the Emacs command loop displays all the warnings specified by this variable, then resets it to `nil`.

Programs which need to further customize the delayed warnings mechanism can change the variable `delayed-warnings-hook`:

*   Variable: **delayed-warnings-hook**

    This is a normal hook which is run by the Emacs command loop, after `post-command-hook`, in order to process and display delayed warnings.

    Its default value is a list of two functions:

        (collapse-delayed-warnings display-delayed-warnings)

    The function `collapse-delayed-warnings` removes repeated entries from `delayed-warnings-list`. The function `display-delayed-warnings` calls `display-warning` on each of the entries in `delayed-warnings-list`, in turn, and then sets `delayed-warnings-list` to `nil`.
