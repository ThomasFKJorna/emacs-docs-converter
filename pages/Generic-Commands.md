#### 21.2.4 Select among Command Alternatives

The macro `define-alternatives` can be used to define *generic commands*. These are interactive functions whose implementation can be selected from several alternatives, as a matter of user preference.

*   Macro: **define-alternatives** *command \&rest customizations*

    Define the new command `command`, a symbol.

    When a user runs `M-x command RET` for the first time, Emacs prompts for which real form of the command to use, and records the selection by way of a custom variable. Using a prefix argument repeats this process of choosing an alternative.

    The variable `command-alternatives` should contain an alist with alternative implementations of `command`. Until this variable is set, `define-alternatives` has no effect.

    If `customizations` is non-`nil`, it should consist of alternating `defcustom` keywords (typically `:group` and `:version`) and values to add to the declaration of `command-alternatives`.
