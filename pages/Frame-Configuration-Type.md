#### 2.5.7 Frame Configuration Type

A *frame configuration* stores information about the positions, sizes, and contents of the windows in all frames. It is not a primitive type—it is actually a list whose CAR is `frame-configuration` and whose CDR is an alist. Each alist element describes one frame, which appears as the CAR of that element.

See [Frame Configurations](Frame-Configurations.html), for a description of several functions related to frame configurations.
