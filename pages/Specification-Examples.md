#### 18.2.15.4 Specification Examples

It may be easier to understand Edebug specifications by studying the examples provided here.

A `let` special form has a sequence of bindings and a body. Each of the bindings is either a symbol or a sublist with a symbol and optional expression. In the specification below, notice the `gate` inside of the sublist to prevent backtracking once a sublist is found.

```lisp
(def-edebug-spec let
  ((&rest
    &or symbolp (gate symbolp &optional form))
   body))
```

Edebug uses the following specifications for `defun` and the associated argument list and `interactive` specifications. It is necessary to handle interactive forms specially since an expression argument is actually evaluated outside of the function body. (The specification for `defmacro` is very similar to that for `defun`, but allows for the `declare` statement.)

```lisp
(def-edebug-spec defun
  (&define name lambda-list
           [&optional stringp]   ; Match the doc string, if present.
           [&optional ("interactive" interactive)]
           def-body))

(def-edebug-spec lambda-list
  (([&rest arg]
    [&optional ["&optional" arg &rest arg]]
    &optional ["&rest" arg]
    )))

(def-edebug-spec interactive
  (&optional &or stringp def-form))    ; Notice: def-form
```

The specification for backquote below illustrates how to match dotted lists and use `nil` to terminate recursion. It also illustrates how components of a vector may be matched. (The actual specification defined by Edebug is a little different, and does not support dotted lists because doing so causes very deep recursion that could fail.)

```lisp
(def-edebug-spec \` (backquote-form))   ; Alias just for clarity.

(def-edebug-spec backquote-form
  (&or ([&or "," ",@"] &or ("quote" backquote-form) form)
       (backquote-form . [&or nil backquote-form])
       (vector &rest backquote-form)
       sexp))
```
