### E.5 Memory Usage

These functions and variables give information about the total amount of memory allocation that Emacs has done, broken down by data type. Note the difference between these and the values returned by `garbage-collect`; those count objects that currently exist, but these count the number or size of all allocations, including those for objects that have since been freed.
