#### 2.4.6.3 Association List Type

An *association list* or *alist* is a specially-constructed list whose elements are cons cells. In each element, the CAR is considered a *key*, and the CDR is considered an *associated value*. (In some cases, the associated value is stored in the CAR of the CDR.) Association lists are often used as stacks, since it is easy to add or remove associations at the front of the list.

For example,

    (setq alist-of-colors
          '((rose . red) (lily . white) (buttercup . yellow)))

sets the variable `alist-of-colors` to an alist of three elements. In the first element, `rose` is the key and `red` is the value.

See [Association Lists](Association-Lists.html), for a further explanation of alists and for functions that work on alists. See [Hash Tables](Hash-Tables.html), for another kind of lookup table, which is much faster for handling a large number of keys.
