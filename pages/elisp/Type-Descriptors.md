#### 2.4.18 Type Descriptors

A *type descriptor* is a `record` which holds information about a type. Slot 1 in the record must be a symbol naming the type, and `type-of` relies on this to return the type of `record` objects. No other type descriptor slot is used by Emacs; they are free for use by Lisp extensions.

An example of a type descriptor is any instance of `cl-structure-class`.
