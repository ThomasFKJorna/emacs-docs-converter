The `setf` macro is the most basic way to operate on generalized variables. The `setf` form is like `setq`, except that it accepts arbitrary place forms on the left side rather than just symbols. For example, `(setf (car a) b)` sets the car of `a` to `b`, doing the same operation as `(setcar a b)`, but without you having to use two separate functions for setting and accessing this type of place.

### Macro: **setf** *\[place form]â€¦*

This macro evaluates `form` and stores it in `place`, which must be a valid generalized variable form. If there are several `place` and `form` pairs, the assignments are done sequentially just as with `setq`. `setf` returns the value of the last `form`.

The following Lisp forms are the forms in Emacs that will work as generalized variables, and so may appear in the `place` argument of `setf`:

A symbol. In other words, `(setf x y)` is exactly equivalent to `(setq x y)`, and `setq` itself is strictly speaking redundant given that `setf` exists. Most programmers will continue to prefer `setq` for setting simple variables, though, for stylistic and historical reasons. The macro `(setf x y)` actually expands to `(setq x y)`, so there is no performance penalty for using it in compiled code.

### A call to any of the following standard Lisp functions:

```lisp
aref      cddr      symbol-function
car       elt       symbol-plist
caar      get       symbol-value
cadr      gethash
cdr       nth
cdar      nthcdr
```

### A call to any of the following Emacs-specific functions:

```lisp
alist-get                     process-get
frame-parameter               process-sentinel
terminal-parameter            window-buffer
keymap-parent                 window-display-table
match-data                    window-dedicated-p
overlay-get                   window-hscroll
overlay-start                 window-parameter
overlay-end                   window-point
process-buffer                window-start
process-filter                default-value
```

`setf` signals an error if you pass a `place` form that it does not know how to handle.

Note that for `nthcdr`, the list argument of the function must itself be a valid `place` form. For example, `(setf (nthcdr 0 foo) 7)` will set `foo` itself to 7.

The macros `push` (see [List Variables](List-Variables.html)) and `pop` (see [List Elements](List-Elements.html)) can manipulate generalized variables, not just lists. `(pop place)` removes and returns the first element of the list stored in `place`. It is analogous to `(prog1 (car place) (setf place (cdr place)))`, except that it takes care to evaluate all subforms only once. `(push x place)` inserts `x` at the front of the list stored in `place`. It is analogous to `(setf place (cons x place))`, except for evaluation of the subforms. Note that `push` and `pop` on an `nthcdr` place can be used to insert or delete at any position in a list.

The `cl-lib` library defines various extensions for generalized variables, including additional `setf` places. See [Generalized Variables](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/cl/Generalized-Variables.html#Generalized-Variables) in Common Lisp Extensions.
