## 8 Hash Tables

A hash table is a very fast kind of lookup table, somewhat like an alist (see [Association Lists](Association-Lists.html)) in that it maps keys to corresponding values. It differs from an alist in these ways:

Lookup in a hash table is extremely fast for large tables—in fact, the time required is essentially *independent* of how many elements are stored in the table. For smaller tables (a few tens of elements) alists may still be faster because hash tables have a more-or-less constant overhead.

The correspondences in a hash table are in no particular order.

There is no way to share structure between two hash tables, the way two alists can share a common tail.

Emacs Lisp provides a general-purpose hash table data type, along with a series of functions for operating on them. Hash tables have a special printed representation, which consists of ‘`#s`’ followed by a list specifying the hash table properties and contents. See [Creating Hash](Creating-Hash.html). (Hash notation, the initial ‘`#`’ character used in the printed representations of objects with no read representation, has nothing to do with hash tables. See [Printed Representation](Printed-Representation.html).)

Obarrays are also a kind of hash table, but they are a different type of object and are used only for recording interned symbols (see [Creating Symbols](Creating-Symbols.html)).
