### 33.8 Scanning for Character Sets

Sometimes it is useful to find out which character set a particular character belongs to. One use for this is in determining which coding systems (see [Coding Systems](Coding-Systems.html)) are capable of representing all of the text in question; another is to determine the font(s) for displaying that text.

*   Function: **charset-after** *\&optional pos*

    This function returns the charset of highest priority containing the character at position `pos` in the current buffer. If `pos` is omitted or `nil`, it defaults to the current value of point. If `pos` is out of range, the value is `nil`.

<!---->

*   Function: **find-charset-region** *beg end \&optional translation*

    This function returns a list of the character sets of highest priority that contain characters in the current buffer between positions `beg` and `end`.

    The optional argument `translation` specifies a translation table to use for scanning the text (see [Translation of Characters](Translation-of-Characters.html)). If it is non-`nil`, then each character in the region is translated through this table, and the value returned describes the translated characters instead of the characters actually in the buffer.

<!---->

*   Function: **find-charset-string** *string \&optional translation*

    This function returns a list of character sets of highest priority that contain characters in `string`. It is just like `find-charset-region`, except that it applies to the contents of `string` instead of part of the current buffer.
