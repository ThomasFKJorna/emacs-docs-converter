### 39.21 Blinking Parentheses

This section describes the mechanism by which Emacs shows a matching open parenthesis when the user inserts a close parenthesis.

### Variable: **blink-paren-function**

The value of this variable should be a function (of no arguments) to be called whenever a character with close parenthesis syntax is inserted. The value of `blink-paren-function` may be `nil`, in which case nothing is done.

### User Option: **blink-matching-paren**

If this variable is `nil`, then `blink-matching-open` does nothing.

### User Option: **blink-matching-paren-distance**

This variable specifies the maximum distance to scan for a matching parenthesis before giving up.

### User Option: **blink-matching-delay**

This variable specifies the number of seconds to keep indicating the matching parenthesis. A fraction of a second often gives good results, but the default is 1, which works on all systems.

### Command: **blink-matching-open**

This function is the default value of `blink-paren-function`. It assumes that point follows a character with close parenthesis syntax and applies the appropriate effect momentarily to the matching opening character. If that character is not already on the screen, it displays the characterâ€™s context in the echo area. To avoid long delays, this function does not search farther than `blink-matching-paren-distance` characters.

Here is an example of calling this function explicitly.

```lisp
(defun interactive-blink-matching-open ()
  "Indicate momentarily the start of parenthesized sexp before point."
  (interactive)
```

```lisp
  (let ((blink-matching-paren-distance
         (buffer-size))
        (blink-matching-paren t))
    (blink-matching-open)))
```
