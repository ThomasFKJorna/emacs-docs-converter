A *vector* is a one-dimensional array of elements of any type. It takes a constant amount of time to access any element of a vector. (In a list, the access time of an element is proportional to the distance of the element from the beginning of the list.)

The printed representation of a vector consists of a left square bracket, the elements, and a right square bracket. This is also the read syntax. Like numbers and strings, vectors are considered constants for evaluation.

```lisp
[1 "two" (three)]      ; A vector of three elements.
     â‡’ [1 "two" (three)]
```

See [Vectors](Vectors.html), for functions that work with vectors.
