#### 16.5.1 Autoload by Prefix

During completion for the commands `describe-variable` and `describe-function`, Emacs will try to load files which may contain definitions matching the prefix being completed. The variable `definition-prefixes` holds a hashtable which maps a prefix to the corresponding list of files to load for it. Entries to this mapping are added by calls to `register-definition-prefixes` which are generated by `update-file-autoloads` (see [Autoload](Autoload.html)). Files which don’t contain any definitions worth loading (test files, for examples), should set `autoload-compute-prefixes` to `nil` as a file-local variable.
