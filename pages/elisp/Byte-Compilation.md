## 17 Byte Compilation

Emacs Lisp has a *compiler* that translates functions written in Lisp into a special representation called *byte-code* that can be executed more efficiently. The compiler replaces Lisp function definitions with byte-code. When a byte-code function is called, its definition is evaluated by the *byte-code interpreter*.

Because the byte-compiled code is evaluated by the byte-code interpreter, instead of being executed directly by the machine’s hardware (as true compiled code is), byte-code is completely transportable from machine to machine without recompilation. It is not, however, as fast as true compiled code.

In general, any version of Emacs can run byte-compiled code produced by recent earlier versions of Emacs, but the reverse is not true.

If you do not want a Lisp file to be compiled, ever, put a file-local variable binding for `no-byte-compile` into it, like this:

```lisp
;; -*-no-byte-compile: t; -*-
```
