#### 2.5.15 Font Type

A *font* specifies how to display text on a graphical terminal. There are actually three separate font types—*font objects*, *font specs*, and *font entities*—each of which has slightly different properties. None of them have a read syntax; their print syntax looks like ‘`#<font-object>`’, ‘`#<font-spec>`’, and ‘`#<font-entity>`’ respectively. See [Low-Level Font](Low_002dLevel-Font.html), for a description of these Lisp objects.
