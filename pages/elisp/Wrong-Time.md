The most common problem in writing macros is doing some of the real work prematurelyâ€”while expanding the macro, rather than in the expansion itself. For instance, one real package had this macro definition:

```lisp
(defmacro my-set-buffer-multibyte (arg)
  (if (fboundp 'set-buffer-multibyte)
      (set-buffer-multibyte arg)))
```

With this erroneous macro definition, the program worked fine when interpreted but failed when compiled. This macro definition called `set-buffer-multibyte` during compilation, which was wrong, and then did nothing when the compiled package was run. The definition that the programmer really wanted was this:

```lisp
(defmacro my-set-buffer-multibyte (arg)
  (if (fboundp 'set-buffer-multibyte)
      `(set-buffer-multibyte ,arg)))
```

This macro expands, if appropriate, into a call to `set-buffer-multibyte` that will be executed when the compiled program is actually run.
