#### 2.4.17 Record Type

A *record* is much like a `vector`. However, the first element is used to hold its type as returned by `type-of`. The purpose of records is to allow programmers to create objects with new types that are not built into Emacs.

See [Records](Records.html), for functions that work with records.
