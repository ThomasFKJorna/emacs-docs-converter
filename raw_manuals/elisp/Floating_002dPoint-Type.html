<p>Floating-point numbers are the computer equivalent of scientific
notation; you can think of a floating-point number as a fraction
together with a power of ten.  The precise number of significant
figures and the range of possible exponents is machine-specific; Emacs
uses the C data type <code>double</code> to store the value, and internally
this records a power of 2 rather than a power of 10.
</p>
<p>The printed representation for floating-point numbers requires either
a decimal point (with at least one digit following), an exponent, or
both.  For example, &lsquo;<samp>1500.0</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>+15e2</samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp>15.0e+2</samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp>+1500000e-3</samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp>.15e4</samp>&rsquo; are five ways of writing a floating-point
number whose value is 1500.  They are all equivalent.
