<span id="Accepting-Output-from-Processes"></span><h4 class="subsection">38.9.4 Accepting Output from Processes</h4>
<span id="index-accept-input-from-processes"></span>

<p>Output from asynchronous subprocesses normally arrives only while
Emacs is waiting for some sort of external event, such as elapsed time
or terminal input.  Occasionally it is useful in a Lisp program to
explicitly permit output to arrive at a specific point, or even to wait
until output arrives from a process.
</p>
<dl>
<dt id="index-accept_002dprocess_002doutput">Function: <strong>accept-process-output</strong> <em>&amp;optional process seconds millisec just-this-one</em></dt>
<dd><p>This function allows Emacs to read pending output from processes.  The
output is given to their filter functions.  If <var>process</var> is
non-<code>nil</code> then this function does not return until some output
has been received from <var>process</var> or <var>process</var> has closed the
connection.
</p>
<p>The arguments <var>seconds</var> and <var>millisec</var> let you specify timeout
periods.  The former specifies a period measured in seconds and the
latter specifies one measured in milliseconds.  The two time periods
thus specified are added together, and <code>accept-process-output</code>
returns after that much time, even if there is no
subprocess output.
</p>
<p>The argument <var>millisec</var> is obsolete (and should not be used),
because <var>seconds</var> can be floating point to specify
waiting a fractional number of seconds.  If <var>seconds</var> is 0, the
function accepts whatever output is pending but does not wait.
</p>
<p>If <var>process</var> is a process, and the argument <var>just-this-one</var> is
non-<code>nil</code>, only output from that process is handled, suspending output
from other processes until some output has been received from that
process or the timeout expires.  If <var>just-this-one</var> is an integer,
also inhibit running timers.  This feature is generally not
recommended, but may be necessary for specific applications, such as
speech synthesis.
</p>
<p>The function <code>accept-process-output</code> returns non-<code>nil</code> if it
got output from <var>process</var>, or from any process if <var>process</var> is
<code>nil</code>; this can occur even after a process has exited if the
corresponding connection contains buffered data.  The function returns
<code>nil</code> if the timeout expired or the connection was closed before output
arrived.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>If a connection from a process contains buffered data,
<code>accept-process-output</code> can return non-<code>nil</code> even after the
process has exited.  Therefore, although the following loop:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">;; This loop contains a bug.
(while (process-live-p process)
  (accept-process-output process))
</pre></div>

<p>will often read all output from <var>process</var>, it has a race condition
and can miss some output if <code>process-live-p</code> returns <code>nil</code>
while the connection still contains data.  Better is to write the loop
like this:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(while (accept-process-output process))
</pre></div>

<p>If you have passed a non-<code>nil</code> <var>stderr</var> to
<code>make-process</code>, it will have a standard error process.
See <a href="Asynchronous-Processes.html">Asynchronous Processes</a>.  In that case, waiting for process
output from the main process doesn&rsquo;t wait for output from the standard
error process.  To make sure you have received both all of standard
output and all of standard error from a process, use the following
code:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(while (accept-process-output process))
(while (accept-process-output stderr-process))
</pre></div>

<p>Reading pending standard error from a process running on a remote host
is not possible this way.
