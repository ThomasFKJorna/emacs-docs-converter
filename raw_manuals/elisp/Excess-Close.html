<span id="index-excess-close-parentheses"></span>

<p>To deal with an excess close parenthesis, first go to the beginning
of the file, then type <kbd>C-u -1 C-M-u</kbd> (<code>backward-up-list</code>
with an argument of -1) to find the end of the first unbalanced
defun.
</p>
<p>Then find the actual matching close parenthesis by typing <kbd>C-M-f</kbd>
(<code>forward-sexp</code>, see <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Expressions.html#Expressions">Expressions</a> in <cite>The GNU Emacs Manual</cite>)
at the beginning of that defun.  This will leave you somewhere short of
the place where the defun ought to end.  It is possible that you will
find a spurious close parenthesis in that vicinity.
</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t see a problem at that point, the next thing to do is to
type <kbd>C-M-q</kbd> (<code>indent-pp-sexp</code>) at the beginning of the defun.
A range of lines will probably shift left; if so, the missing open
parenthesis or spurious close parenthesis is probably near the first of
those lines.  (However, don&rsquo;t assume this is true; study the code to
make sure.)  Once you have found the discrepancy, undo the <kbd>C-M-q</kbd>
with <kbd>C-_</kbd> (<code>undo</code>), since the old indentation is probably
appropriate to the intended parentheses.
</p>
<p>After you think you have fixed the problem, use <kbd>C-M-q</kbd> again.  If
the old indentation actually fits the intended nesting of parentheses,
and you have put back those parentheses, <kbd>C-M-q</kbd> should not change
anything.
