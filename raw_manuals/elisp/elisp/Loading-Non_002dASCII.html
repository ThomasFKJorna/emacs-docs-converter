<p>When Emacs Lisp programs contain string constants with non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym>
characters, these can be represented within Emacs either as unibyte
strings or as multibyte strings (see <a href="Text-Representations.html">Text Representations</a>).  Which
representation is used depends on how the file is read into Emacs.  If
it is read with decoding into multibyte representation, the text of the
Lisp program will be multibyte text, and its string constants will be
multibyte strings.  If a file containing Latin-1 characters (for
example) is read without decoding, the text of the program will be
unibyte text, and its string constants will be unibyte strings.
See <a href="Coding-Systems.html">Coding Systems</a>.
</p>
<p>In most Emacs Lisp programs, the fact that non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym>
strings are multibyte strings should not be noticeable, since
inserting them in unibyte buffers converts them to unibyte
automatically.  However, if this does make a difference, you can force
a particular Lisp file to be interpreted as unibyte by writing
&lsquo;<samp>coding: raw-text</samp>&rsquo; in a local variables section.  With
that designator, the file will unconditionally be interpreted as
unibyte.  This can matter when making keybindings to
non-<acronym>ASCII</acronym> characters written as <code>?v<var>literal</var></code>.
