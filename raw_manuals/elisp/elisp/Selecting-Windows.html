<dl>
<dt id="index-select_002dwindow">Function: <strong>select-window</strong> <em>window &amp;optional norecord</em></dt>
<dd><p>This function makes <var>window</var> the selected window and the window
selected within its frame (see <a href="Basic-Windows.html">Basic Windows</a>), and selects that
frame.  It also makes <var>window</var>&rsquo;s buffer (see <a href="Buffers-and-Windows.html">Buffers and Windows</a>) current and sets that buffer&rsquo;s value of <code>point</code> to the
value of <code>window-point</code> (see <a href="Window-Point.html">Window Point</a>) in <var>window</var>.
<var>window</var> must be a live window.  The return value is <var>window</var>.
</p>
<p>By default, this function also moves <var>window</var>&rsquo;s buffer to the front
of the buffer list (see <a href="Buffer-List.html">Buffer List</a>) and makes <var>window</var> the most
recently selected window.  If the optional argument <var>norecord</var> is
non-<code>nil</code>, these additional actions are omitted.
</p>
<p>In addition, this function by default also tells the display engine to
update the display of <var>window</var> when its frame gets redisplayed the
next time.  If <var>norecord</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, such updates are
usually not performed.  If, however, <var>norecord</var> equals the special
symbol <code>mark-for-redisplay</code>, the additional actions mentioned above
are omitted but <var>window</var> will be nevertheless updated.
</p>
<p>Note that sometimes selecting a window is not enough to show it, or
make its frame the top-most frame on display: you may also need to
raise the frame or make sure input focus is directed to that frame.
See <a href="Input-Focus.html">Input Focus</a>.

<span id="index-select-window-hooks"></span>
<span id="index-running-a-hook-when-a-window-gets-selected"></span>
<p>For historical reasons, Emacs does not run a separate hook whenever a
window gets selected.  Applications and internal routines often
temporarily select a window to perform a few actions on it.  They do
that either to simplify coding&mdash;because many functions by default
operate on the selected window when no <var>window</var> argument is
specified&mdash;or because some functions did not (and still do not) take a
window as argument and always operate(d) on the selected window instead.
Running a hook every time a window gets selected for a short time and
once more when the previously selected window gets restored is not
useful.
</p>
<p>However, when its <var>norecord</var> argument is <code>nil</code>,
<code>select-window</code> updates the buffer list and thus indirectly runs
the normal hook <code>buffer-list-update-hook</code> (see <a href="Buffer-List.html">Buffer List</a>).
Consequently, that hook provides one way to run a function whenever a
window gets selected more &ldquo;permanently&rdquo;.
</p>
<p>Since <code>buffer-list-update-hook</code> is also run by functions that are
not related to window management, it will usually make sense to save the
value of the selected window somewhere and compare it with the value of
<code>selected-window</code> while running that hook.  Also, to avoid false
positives when using <code>buffer-list-update-hook</code>, it is good practice
that every <code>select-window</code> call supposed to select a window only
temporarily passes a non-<code>nil</code> <var>norecord</var> argument.  If
possible, the macro <code>with-selected-window</code> (see below) should be
used in such cases.
</p>
<p>Emacs also runs the hook <code>window-selection-change-functions</code>
whenever the redisplay routine detects that another window has been
selected since last redisplay.  See <a href="Window-Hooks.html">Window Hooks</a>, for a detailed
explanation.  <code>window-state-change-functions</code> (described in the
same section) is another abnormal hook run after a different window
has been selected but is triggered by other window changes as well.
</p>
<span id="index-most-recently-selected-windows"></span>
<p>The sequence of calls to <code>select-window</code> with a non-<code>nil</code>
<var>norecord</var> argument determines an ordering of windows by their
selection time.  The function <code>get-lru-window</code> can be used to
retrieve the least recently selected live window (see <a href="Cyclic-Window-Ordering.html">Cyclic Window Ordering</a>).
</p>
<dl>
<dt id="index-save_002dselected_002dwindow">Macro: <strong>save-selected-window</strong> <em>forms&hellip;</em></dt>
<dd><p>This macro records the selected frame, as well as the selected window
of each frame, executes <var>forms</var> in sequence, then restores the
earlier selected frame and windows.  It also saves and restores the
current buffer.  It returns the value of the last form in <var>forms</var>.
</p>
<p>This macro does not save or restore anything about the sizes,
arrangement or contents of windows; therefore, if <var>forms</var> change
them, the change persists.  If the previously selected window of some
frame is no longer live at the time of exit from <var>forms</var>, that
frame&rsquo;s selected window is left alone.  If the previously selected
window is no longer live, then whatever window is selected at the end of
<var>forms</var> remains selected.  The current buffer is restored if and
only if it is still live when exiting <var>forms</var>.
</p>
<p>This macro changes neither the ordering of recently selected windows nor
the buffer list.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-with_002dselected_002dwindow">Macro: <strong>with-selected-window</strong> <em>window forms&hellip;</em></dt>
<dd><p>This macro selects <var>window</var>, executes <var>forms</var> in sequence, then
restores the previously selected window and current buffer.  The
ordering of recently selected windows and the buffer list remain
unchanged unless you deliberately change them within <var>forms</var>; for
example, by calling <code>select-window</code> with argument <var>norecord</var>
<code>nil</code>.  Hence, this macro is the preferred way to temporarily work
with <var>window</var> as the selected window without needlessly running
<code>buffer-list-update-hook</code>.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-frame_002dselected_002dwindow">Function: <strong>frame-selected-window</strong> <em>&amp;optional frame</em></dt>
<dd><p>This function returns the window on <var>frame</var> that is selected
within that frame.  <var>frame</var> should be a live frame; if omitted or
<code>nil</code>, it defaults to the selected frame.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-set_002dframe_002dselected_002dwindow">Function: <strong>set-frame-selected-window</strong> <em>frame window &amp;optional norecord</em></dt>
<dd><p>This function makes <var>window</var> the window selected within the frame
<var>frame</var>.  <var>frame</var> should be a live frame; if <code>nil</code>, it
defaults to the selected frame.  <var>window</var> should be a live window;
if <code>nil</code>, it defaults to the selected window.
</p>
<p>If <var>frame</var> is the selected frame, this makes <var>window</var> the
selected window.
</p>
<p>If the optional argument <var>norecord</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, this
function does not alter the list of most recently selected windows,
nor the buffer list.

<dl>
<dt id="index-window_002duse_002dtime">Function: <strong>window-use-time</strong> <em>&amp;optional window</em></dt>
<dd><p>This functions returns the use time of window <var>window</var>.
<var>window</var> must be a live window and defaults to the selected one.
</p>
<p>The <em>use time</em> of a window is not really a time value, but an
integer that does increase monotonically with each call of
<code>select-window</code> with a <code>nil</code> <var>norecord</var> argument.  The
window with the lowest use time is usually called the least recently
used window while the window with the highest use time is called the
most recently used one (see <a href="Cyclic-Window-Ordering.html">Cyclic Window Ordering</a>).
