<span id="Window-History-1"></span><h3 class="section">28.14 Window History</h3>
<span id="index-window-history"></span>

<p>Each window remembers in a list the buffers it has previously
displayed, and the order in which these buffers were removed from it.
This history is used, for example, by <code>replace-buffer-in-windows</code>
(see <a href="Buffers-and-Windows.html">Buffers and Windows</a>), and when quitting windows
(see <a href="Quitting-Windows.html">Quitting Windows</a>).  The list is automatically maintained by
Emacs, but you can use the following functions to explicitly inspect
or alter it:
</p>
<dl>
<dt id="index-window_002dprev_002dbuffers">Function: <strong>window-prev-buffers</strong> <em>&amp;optional window</em></dt>
<dd><p>This function returns a list specifying the previous contents of
<var>window</var>.  The optional argument <var>window</var> should be a live
window and defaults to the selected one.
</p>
<p>Each list element has the form <code>(<var>buffer</var> <var>window-start</var>
<var>window-pos</var>)</code>, where <var>buffer</var> is a buffer previously shown in
the window, <var>window-start</var> is the window start position
(see <a href="Window-Start-and-End.html">Window Start and End</a>) when that buffer was last shown, and
<var>window-pos</var> is the point position (see <a href="Window-Point.html">Window Point</a>) when
that buffer was last shown in <var>window</var>.
</p>
<p>The list is ordered so that earlier elements correspond to more
recently-shown buffers, and the first element usually corresponds to the
buffer most recently removed from the window.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-set_002dwindow_002dprev_002dbuffers">Function: <strong>set-window-prev-buffers</strong> <em>window prev-buffers</em></dt>
<dd><p>This function sets <var>window</var>&rsquo;s previous buffers to the value of
<var>prev-buffers</var>.  The argument <var>window</var> must be a live window
and defaults to the selected one.  The argument <var>prev-buffers</var>
should be a list of the same form as that returned by
<code>window-prev-buffers</code>.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>In addition, each window maintains a list of <em>next buffers</em>, which
is a list of buffers re-shown by <code>switch-to-prev-buffer</code> (see
below).  This list is mainly used by <code>switch-to-prev-buffer</code> and
<code>switch-to-next-buffer</code> for choosing buffers to switch to.
</p>
<dl>
<dt id="index-window_002dnext_002dbuffers">Function: <strong>window-next-buffers</strong> <em>&amp;optional window</em></dt>
<dd><p>This function returns the list of buffers recently re-shown in
<var>window</var> via <code>switch-to-prev-buffer</code>.  The <var>window</var>
argument must denote a live window or <code>nil</code> (meaning the selected
window).
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-set_002dwindow_002dnext_002dbuffers">Function: <strong>set-window-next-buffers</strong> <em>window next-buffers</em></dt>
<dd><p>This function sets the next buffer list of <var>window</var> to
<var>next-buffers</var>.  The <var>window</var> argument should be a live window
or <code>nil</code> (meaning the selected window).  The argument
<var>next-buffers</var> should be a list of buffers.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>The following commands can be used to cycle through the global buffer
list, much like <code>bury-buffer</code> and <code>unbury-buffer</code>.  However,
they cycle according to the specified window&rsquo;s history list, rather
than the global buffer list.  In addition, they restore
window-specific window start and point positions, and may show a
buffer even if it is already shown in another window.  The
<code>switch-to-prev-buffer</code> command, in particular, is used by
<code>replace-buffer-in-windows</code>, <code>bury-buffer</code> and
<code>quit-window</code> to find a replacement buffer for a window.
</p>
<dl>
<dt id="index-switch_002dto_002dprev_002dbuffer">Command: <strong>switch-to-prev-buffer</strong> <em>&amp;optional window bury-or-kill</em></dt>
<dd><p>This command displays the previous buffer in <var>window</var>.  The
argument <var>window</var> should be a live window or <code>nil</code> (meaning
the selected window).  If the optional argument <var>bury-or-kill</var> is
non-<code>nil</code>, this means that the buffer currently shown in
<var>window</var> is about to be buried or killed and consequently should
not be switched to in future invocations of this command.
</p>
<p>The previous buffer is usually the buffer shown before the buffer
currently shown in <var>window</var>.  However, a buffer that has been buried
or killed, or has been already shown by a recent invocation of
<code>switch-to-prev-buffer</code>, does not qualify as previous buffer.
</p>
<p>If repeated invocations of this command have already shown all buffers
previously shown in <var>window</var>, further invocations will show buffers
from the buffer list of the frame <var>window</var> appears on (see <a href="Buffer-List.html">Buffer List</a>).
</p>
<p>The option <code>switch-to-prev-buffer-skip</code> described below can be
used to inhibit switching to certain buffers, for example, to those
already shown in another window.  Also, if <var>window</var>&rsquo;s frame has a
<code>buffer-predicate</code> parameter (see <a href="Buffer-Parameters.html">Buffer Parameters</a>), that
predicate may inhibit switching to certain buffers.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-switch_002dto_002dnext_002dbuffer">Command: <strong>switch-to-next-buffer</strong> <em>&amp;optional window</em></dt>
<dd><p>This command switches to the next buffer in <var>window</var>, thus undoing
the effect of the last <code>switch-to-prev-buffer</code> command in
<var>window</var>.  The argument <var>window</var> must be a live window and
defaults to the selected one.
</p>
<p>If there is no recent invocation of <code>switch-to-prev-buffer</code> that
can be undone, this function tries to show a buffer from the buffer list
of the frame <var>window</var> appears on (see <a href="Buffer-List.html">Buffer List</a>).
</p>
<p>The option <code>switch-to-prev-buffer-skip</code> and the
<code>buffer-predicate</code> (see <a href="Buffer-Parameters.html">Buffer Parameters</a>) of <var>window</var>&rsquo;s
frame affect this command as they do for <code>switch-to-prev-buffer</code>.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>By default <code>switch-to-prev-buffer</code> and
<code>switch-to-next-buffer</code> can switch to a buffer that is already
shown in another window.  The following option can be used to override
this behavior.
</p>
<dl>
<dt id="index-switch_002dto_002dprev_002dbuffer_002dskip">User Option: <strong>switch-to-prev-buffer-skip</strong></dt>
<dd><p>If this variable is <code>nil</code>, <code>switch-to-prev-buffer</code> may
switch to any buffer, including those already shown in other windows.
</p>
<p>If this variable is non-<code>nil</code>, <code>switch-to-prev-buffer</code> will
refrain from switching to certain buffers.  The following values can
be used:
</p>
<ul>
<li> <code>this</code> means do not switch to a buffer shown on the frame that
hosts the window <code>switch-to-prev-buffer</code> is acting upon.

</li><li> <code>visible</code> means do not switch to a buffer shown on any visible
frame.

</li><li> 0 (the number zero) means do not switch to a buffer shown on any
visible or iconified frame.

</li><li> <code>t</code> means do not switch to a buffer shown on any live frame.

</li><li> A function that takes three arguments&mdash;the <var>window</var> argument of
<code>switch-to-prev-buffer</code>, a buffer <code>switch-to-prev-buffer</code>
intends to switch to and the <var>bury-or-kill</var> argument of
<code>switch-to-prev-buffer</code>.  If that function returns
non-<code>nil</code>, <code>switch-to-prev-buffer</code> will refrain from
switching to the buffer specified by the second argument.
</li></ul>

<p>The command <code>switch-to-next-buffer</code> obeys this option in a
similar way.  If this option specifies a function,
<code>switch-to-next-buffer</code> will call that function with the third
argument always <code>nil</code>.
</p>
<p>Note that since <code>switch-to-prev-buffer</code> is called by
<code>bury-buffer</code>, <code>replace-buffer-in-windows</code> and
<code>quit-restore-window</code> as well, customizing this option may also
affect the behavior of Emacs when a window is quit or a buffer gets
buried or killed.
</p>
<p>Note also that under certain circumstances
<code>switch-to-prev-buffer</code> and <code>switch-to-next-buffer</code> may
ignore this option, for example, when there is only one buffer left
these functions can switch to.
</p></dd></dl>
