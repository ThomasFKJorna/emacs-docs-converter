<p>A <em>thread</em> in Emacs represents a separate thread of Emacs Lisp
execution.  It runs its own Lisp program, has its own current buffer,
and can have subprocesses locked to it, i.e. subprocesses whose
output only this thread can accept.  See <a href="Threads.html">Threads</a>.
</p>
<p>Thread objects have no read syntax.  They print in hash notation,
giving the name of the thread (if it has been given a name) or its
address in core:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(all-threads)
    &rArr; (#&lt;thread 0176fc40&gt;)
</pre></div>
