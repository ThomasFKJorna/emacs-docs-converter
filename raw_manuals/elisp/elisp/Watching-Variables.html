<span id="index-variable-watchpoints"></span>
<span id="index-watchpoints-for-Lisp-variables"></span>

<p>It is sometimes useful to take some action when a variable changes its
value.  The <em>variable watchpoint</em> facility provides the means to
do so.  Some possible uses for this feature include keeping display in
sync with variable settings, and invoking the debugger to track down
unexpected changes to variables (see <a href="Variable-Debugging.html">Variable Debugging</a>).
</p>
<p>The following functions may be used to manipulate and query the watch
functions for a variable.
</p>
<dl>
<dt id="index-add_002dvariable_002dwatcher">Function: <strong>add-variable-watcher</strong> <em>symbol watch-function</em></dt>
<dd><p>This function arranges for <var>watch-function</var> to be called whenever
<var>symbol</var> is modified.  Modifications through aliases
(see <a href="Variable-Aliases.html">Variable Aliases</a>) will have the same effect.
</p>
<p><var>watch-function</var> will be called, just before changing the value of
<var>symbol</var>, with 4 arguments: <var>symbol</var>, <var>newval</var>,
<var>operation</var>, and <var>where</var>.
<var>symbol</var> is the variable being changed.  <var>newval</var> is the value
it will be changed to.  (The old value is available to
<var>watch-function</var> as the value of <var>symbol</var>, since it was not
yet changed to <var>newval</var>.)  <var>operation</var> is a symbol
representing the kind of change, one of: <code>set</code>, <code>let</code>,
<code>unlet</code>, <code>makunbound</code>, or <code>defvaralias</code>.  <var>where</var>
is a buffer if the buffer-local value of the variable is being
changed, <code>nil</code> otherwise.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-remove_002dvariable_002dwatcher">Function: <strong>remove-variable-watcher</strong> <em>symbol watch-function</em></dt>
<dd><p>This function removes <var>watch-function</var> from <var>symbol</var>&rsquo;s list of
watchers.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-get_002dvariable_002dwatchers">Function: <strong>get-variable-watchers</strong> <em>symbol</em></dt>
<dd><p>This function returns the list of <var>symbol</var>&rsquo;s active watcher
functions.
</p></dd></dl>

<span id="Limitations"></span><h4 class="subsection">12.9.1 Limitations</h4>

<p>There are a couple of ways in which a variable could be modified (or at
least appear to be modified) without triggering a watchpoint.
</p>
<p>Since watchpoints are attached to symbols, modification to the
objects contained within variables (e.g., by a list modification
function see <a href="Modifying-Lists.html">Modifying Lists</a>) is not caught by this mechanism.
</p>
<p>Additionally, C code can modify the value of variables directly,
bypassing the watchpoint mechanism.
</p>
<p>A minor limitation of this feature, again because it targets symbols,
is that only variables of dynamic scope may be watched.  This poses
little difficulty, since modifications to lexical variables can be
discovered easily by inspecting the code within the scope of the
variable (unlike dynamic variables, which can be modified by any code
at all, see <a href="Variable-Scoping.html">Variable Scoping</a>).
