<p>Emacs Lisp provides a limited form of concurrency, called
<em>threads</em>.  All the threads in a given instance of Emacs share the
same memory.  Concurrency in Emacs Lisp is &ldquo;mostly cooperative&rdquo;,
meaning that Emacs will only switch execution between threads at
well-defined times.  However, the Emacs thread support has been
designed in a way to later allow more fine-grained concurrency, and
correct programs should not rely on cooperative threading.
</p>
<p>Currently, thread switching will occur upon explicit request via
<code>thread-yield</code>, when waiting for keyboard input or for process
output from asynchronous processes (e.g., during
<code>accept-process-output</code>), or during blocking operations relating
to threads, such as mutex locking or <code>thread-join</code>.
</p>
<p>Emacs Lisp provides primitives to create and control threads, and
also to create and control mutexes and condition variables, useful for
thread synchronization.
</p>
<p>While global variables are shared among all Emacs Lisp threads,
local variables are not&mdash;a dynamic <code>let</code> binding is local.  Each
thread also has its own current buffer (see <a href="Current-Buffer.html">Current Buffer</a>) and
its own match data (see <a href="Match-Data.html">Match Data</a>).
</p>
<p>Note that <code>let</code> bindings are treated specially by the Emacs
Lisp implementation.  There is no way to duplicate this unwinding and
rewinding behavior other than by using <code>let</code>.  For example, a
manual implementation of <code>let</code> written using
<code>unwind-protect</code> cannot arrange for variable values to be
thread-specific.
</p>
<p>In the case of lexical bindings (see <a href="Variable-Scoping.html">Variable Scoping</a>), a
closure is an object like any other in Emacs Lisp, and bindings in a
closure are shared by any threads invoking the closure.
