<span id="index-processes_002c-threads"></span>

<p>Because threads were a relatively late addition to Emacs Lisp, and
due to the way dynamic binding was sometimes used in conjunction with
<code>accept-process-output</code>, by default a process is locked to the
thread that created it.  When a process is locked to a thread, output
from the process can only be accepted by that thread.
</p>
<p>A Lisp program can specify to which thread a process is to be
locked, or instruct Emacs to unlock a process, in which case its
output can be processed by any thread.  Only a single thread will wait
for output from a given process at one time&mdash;once one thread begins
waiting for output, the process is temporarily locked until
<code>accept-process-output</code> or <code>sit-for</code> returns.
</p>
<p>If the thread exits, all the processes locked to it are unlocked.
