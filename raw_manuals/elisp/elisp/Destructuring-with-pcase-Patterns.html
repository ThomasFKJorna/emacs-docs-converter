<span id="Destructuring-with-pcase-Patterns-1"></span><h4 class="subsection">11.4.4 Destructuring with <code>pcase</code> Patterns</h4>
<span id="index-destructuring-with-pcase-patterns"></span>

<p>Pcase patterns not only express a condition on the form of the objects
they can match, but they can also extract sub-fields of those objects.
For example we can extract 2 elements from a list that is the value of
the variable <code>my-list</code> with the following code:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">  (pcase my-list
    (`(add ,x ,y)  (message &quot;Contains %S and %S&quot; x y)))
</pre></div>

<p>This will not only extract <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> but will additionally
test that <code>my-list</code> is a list containing exactly 3 elements and
whose first element is the symbol <code>add</code>.  If any of those tests
fail, <code>pcase</code> will immediately return <code>nil</code> without calling
<code>message</code>.
</p>
<p>Extraction of multiple values stored in an object is known as
<em>destructuring</em>.  Using <code>pcase</code> patterns allows to perform
<em>destructuring binding</em>, which is similar to a local binding
(see <a href="Local-Variables.html">Local Variables</a>), but gives values to multiple elements of
a variable by extracting those values from an object of compatible
structure.
</p>
<p>The macros described in this section use <code>pcase</code> patterns to
perform destructuring binding.  The condition of the object to be of
compatible structure means that the object must match the pattern,
because only then the object&rsquo;s subfields can be extracted.  For
example:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">  (pcase-let ((`(add ,x ,y) my-list))
    (message &quot;Contains %S and %S&quot; x y))
</pre></div>

<p>does the same as the previous example, except that it directly tries
to extract <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> from <code>my-list</code> without first
verifying if <code>my-list</code> is a list which has the right number of
elements and has <code>add</code> as its first element.  The precise
behavior when the object does not actually match the pattern is
undefined, although the body will not be silently skipped: either an
error is signaled or the body is run with some of the variables
potentially bound to arbitrary values like <code>nil</code>.
</p>
<p>The pcase patterns that are useful for destructuring bindings are
generally those described in <a href="Backquote-Patterns.html">Backquote Patterns</a>, since they
express a specification of the structure of objects that will match.
</p>
<p>For an alternative facility for destructuring binding, see
<a href="Sequence-Functions.html#seq_002dlet">seq-let</a>.

<dd><p>Perform destructuring binding of variables according to
<var>bindings</var>, and then evaluate <var>body</var>.
</p>
<p><var>bindings</var> is a list of bindings of the form <code>(<var>pattern</var>&nbsp;<var>exp</var>)</code><!-- /@w -->, where <var>exp</var> is an expression to evaluate and
<var>pattern</var> is a <code>pcase</code> pattern.
</p>
<p>All <var>exp</var>s are evaluated first, after which they are matched
against their respective <var>pattern</var>, introducing new variable
bindings that can then be used inside <var>body</var>.  The variable
bindings are produced by destructuring binding of elements of
<var>pattern</var> to the values of the corresponding elements of the
evaluated <var>exp</var>.

<dd><p>Perform destructuring binding of variables according to
<var>bindings</var>, and then evaluate <var>body</var>.
</p>
<p><var>bindings</var> is a list of bindings of the form <code>(<var>pattern</var>
<var>exp</var>)</code>, where <var>exp</var> is an expression to evaluate and
<var>pattern</var> is a <code>pcase</code> pattern.  The variable bindings are
produced by destructuring binding of elements of <var>pattern</var> to the
values of the corresponding elements of the evaluated <var>exp</var>.
</p>
<p>Unlike <code>pcase-let</code>, but similarly to <code>let*</code>, each <var>exp</var>
is matched against its corresponding <var>pattern</var> before processing
the next element of <var>bindings</var>, so the variable bindings
introduced in each one of the <var>bindings</var> are available in the
<var>exp</var>s of the <var>bindings</var> that follow it, additionally to
being available in <var>body</var>.

<code>pcase-let</code>.  When <var>pattern</var> is a simple variable, this ends
up being equivalent to <code>dolist</code> (see <a href="Iteration.html">Iteration</a>).
