<span id="Creating-and-Maintaining-Package-Archives"></span><h3 class="section">41.4 Creating and Maintaining Package Archives</h3>
<span id="index-package-archive"></span>

<p>Via the Package Menu, users may download packages from <em>package
archives</em>.  Such archives are specified by the variable
<code>package-archives</code>, whose default value contains a single entry:
the archive hosted by the GNU project at <a href="https://elpa.gnu.org">https://elpa.gnu.org</a>.  This
section describes how to set up and maintain a package archive.
</p>
<span id="index-base-location_002c-package-archive"></span>
<dl>
<dt id="index-package_002darchives">User Option: <strong>package-archives</strong></dt>
<dd><p>The value of this variable is an alist of package archives recognized
by the Emacs package manager.
</p>
<p>Each alist element corresponds to one archive, and should have the
form <code>(<var>id</var> . <var>location</var>)</code>, where <var>id</var> is the name of
the archive (a string) and <var>location</var> is its <em>base location</em>
(a string).
</p>
<p>If the base location starts with &lsquo;<samp>http:</samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp>https:</samp>&rsquo;, it
is treated as an HTTP(S) URL, and packages are downloaded from this
archive via HTTP(S) (as is the case for the default GNU archive).
</p>
<p>Otherwise, the base location should be a directory name.  In this
case, Emacs retrieves packages from this archive via ordinary file
access.  Such local archives are mainly useful for testing.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>A package archive is simply a directory in which the package files,
and associated files, are stored.  If you want the archive to be
reachable via HTTP, this directory must be accessible to a web server;
See <a href="Archive-Web-Server.html">Archive Web Server</a>.
</p>
<p>A convenient way to set up and update a package archive is via the
<code>package-x</code> library.  This is included with Emacs, but not loaded
by default; type <kbd>M-x load-library <span class="key">RET</span> package-x <span class="key">RET</span></kbd> to
load it, or add <code>(require 'package-x)</code> to your init file.
See <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Lisp-Libraries.html#Lisp-Libraries">Lisp Libraries</a> in <cite>The GNU Emacs Manual</cite>.
</p>
<p>After you create an archive, remember that it is not accessible in the
Package Menu interface unless it is in <code>package-archives</code>.
</p>
<span id="index-package-archive-security"></span>
<span id="index-package-signing"></span>
<p>Maintaining a public package archive entails a degree of responsibility.
When Emacs users install packages from your archive, those packages
can cause Emacs to run arbitrary code with the permissions of the
installing user.  (This is true for Emacs code in general, not just
for packages.)  So you should ensure that your archive is
well-maintained and keep the hosting system secure.
</p>
<p>One way to increase the security of your packages is to <em>sign</em>
them using a cryptographic key.  If you have generated a
private/public gpg key pair, you can use gpg to sign the package like
this:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">gpg -ba -o <var>file</var>.sig <var>file</var>
</pre></div>

<p>For a single-file package, <var>file</var> is the package Lisp file;
for a multi-file package, it is the package tar file.
You can also sign the archive&rsquo;s contents file in the same way.
Make the <samp>.sig</samp> files available in the same location as the packages.
You should also make your public key available for people to download;
e.g., by uploading it to a key server such as <a href="https://pgp.mit.edu/">https://pgp.mit.edu/</a>.
When people install packages from your archive, they can use
your public key to verify the signatures.
</p>
<p>A full explanation of these matters is outside the scope of this
manual.  For more information on cryptographic keys and signing,
see <a href="https://www.gnupg.org/documentation/manuals/gnupg/index.html#Top">GnuPG</a> in <cite>The GNU Privacy Guard Manual</cite>.  Emacs comes
with an interface to GNU Privacy Guard, see <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/epa/index.html#Top">EasyPG</a> in <cite>Emacs EasyPG Assistant Manual</cite>.
