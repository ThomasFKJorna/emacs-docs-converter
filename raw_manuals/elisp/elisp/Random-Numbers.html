<span id="index-random-numbers"></span>

<p>A deterministic computer program cannot generate true random
numbers.  For most purposes, <em>pseudo-random numbers</em> suffice.  A
series of pseudo-random numbers is generated in a deterministic
fashion.  The numbers are not truly random, but they have certain
properties that mimic a random series.  For example, all possible
values occur equally often in a pseudo-random series.
</p>
<span id="index-seed_002c-for-random-number-generation"></span>
<p>Pseudo-random numbers are generated from a <em>seed value</em>.  Starting from
any given seed, the <code>random</code> function always generates the same
sequence of numbers.  By default, Emacs initializes the random seed at
startup, in such a way that the sequence of values of <code>random</code>
(with overwhelming likelihood) differs in each Emacs run.
</p>
<p>Sometimes you want the random number sequence to be repeatable.  For
example, when debugging a program whose behavior depends on the random
number sequence, it is helpful to get the same behavior in each
program run.  To make the sequence repeat, execute <code>(random &quot;&quot;)</code>.
This sets the seed to a constant value for your particular Emacs
executable (though it may differ for other Emacs builds).  You can use
other strings to choose various seed values.
</p>
<dl>
<dt id="index-random">Function: <strong>random</strong> <em>&amp;optional limit</em></dt>
<dd><p>This function returns a pseudo-random integer.  Repeated calls return a
series of pseudo-random integers.
</p>
<p>If <var>limit</var> is a positive fixnum, the value is chosen to be
nonnegative and less than <var>limit</var>.  Otherwise, the value might be
any fixnum, i.e., any integer from <code>most-negative-fixnum</code> through
<code>most-positive-fixnum</code> (see <a href="Integer-Basics.html">Integer Basics</a>).
</p>
<p>If <var>limit</var> is <code>t</code>, it means to choose a new seed as if Emacs
were restarting, typically from the system entropy.  On systems
lacking entropy pools, choose the seed from less-random volatile data
such as the current time.
</p>
<p>If <var>limit</var> is a string, it means to choose a new seed based on the
string&rsquo;s contents.
