<p>Evaluating forms in the order they appear is the most common way
control passes from one form to another.  In some contexts, such as in a
function body, this happens automatically.  Elsewhere you must use a
control structure construct to do this: <code>progn</code>, the simplest
control construct of Lisp.
</p>
<p>A <code>progn</code> special form looks like this:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(progn <var>a</var> <var>b</var> <var>c</var> &hellip;)
</pre></div>

<p>and it says to execute the forms <var>a</var>, <var>b</var>, <var>c</var>, and so on, in
that order.  These forms are called the <em>body</em> of the <code>progn</code> form.
The value of the last form in the body becomes the value of the entire
<code>progn</code>.  <code>(progn)</code> returns <code>nil</code>.
</p>
<span id="index-implicit-progn"></span>
<p>In the early days of Lisp, <code>progn</code> was the only way to execute
two or more forms in succession and use the value of the last of them.
But programmers found they often needed to use a <code>progn</code> in the
body of a function, where (at that time) only one form was allowed.  So
the body of a function was made into an implicit <code>progn</code>:
several forms are allowed just as in the body of an actual <code>progn</code>.
Many other control structures likewise contain an implicit <code>progn</code>.
As a result, <code>progn</code> is not used as much as it was many years ago.
It is needed now most often inside an <code>unwind-protect</code>, <code>and</code>,
<code>or</code>, or in the <var>then</var>-part of an <code>if</code>.
</p>
<dl>
<dt id="index-progn">Special Form: <strong>progn</strong> <em>forms&hellip;</em></dt>
<dd><p>This special form evaluates all of the <var>forms</var>, in textual
order, returning the result of the final form.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(progn (print &quot;The first form&quot;)
       (print &quot;The second form&quot;)
       (print &quot;The third form&quot;))
     -| &quot;The first form&quot;
     -| &quot;The second form&quot;
     -| &quot;The third form&quot;
&rArr; &quot;The third form&quot;
</pre></div>
</dd></dl>

<p>Two other constructs likewise evaluate a series of forms but return
different values:
</p>
<dl>
<dt id="index-prog1">Special Form: <strong>prog1</strong> <em>form1 forms&hellip;</em></dt>
<dd><p>This special form evaluates <var>form1</var> and all of the <var>forms</var>, in
textual order, returning the result of <var>form1</var>.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(prog1 (print &quot;The first form&quot;)
       (print &quot;The second form&quot;)
       (print &quot;The third form&quot;))
     -| &quot;The first form&quot;
     -| &quot;The second form&quot;
     -| &quot;The third form&quot;
&rArr; &quot;The first form&quot;
</pre></div>

<p>Here is a way to remove the first element from a list in the variable
<code>x</code>, then return the value of that former element:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(prog1 (car x) (setq x (cdr x)))
</pre></div>
</dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-prog2">Special Form: <strong>prog2</strong> <em>form1 form2 forms&hellip;</em></dt>
<dd><p>This special form evaluates <var>form1</var>, <var>form2</var>, and all of the
following <var>forms</var>, in textual order, returning the result of
<var>form2</var>.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(prog2 (print &quot;The first form&quot;)
       (print &quot;The second form&quot;)
       (print &quot;The third form&quot;))
     -| &quot;The first form&quot;
     -| &quot;The second form&quot;
     -| &quot;The third form&quot;
&rArr; &quot;The second form&quot;
</pre></div>
</dd></dl>
