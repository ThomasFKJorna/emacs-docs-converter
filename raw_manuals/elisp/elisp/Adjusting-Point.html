<p>Emacs cannot display the cursor when point is in the middle of a
sequence of text that has the <code>display</code> or <code>composition</code>
property, or is invisible.  Therefore, after a command finishes and
returns to the command loop, if point is within such a sequence, the
command loop normally moves point to the edge of the sequence, making this
sequence effectively intangible.
</p>
<p>A command can inhibit this feature by setting the variable
<code>disable-point-adjustment</code>:
</p>
<dl>
<dt id="index-disable_002dpoint_002dadjustment">Variable: <strong>disable-point-adjustment</strong></dt>
<dd><p>If this variable is non-<code>nil</code> when a command returns to the
command loop, then the command loop does not check for those text
properties, and does not move point out of sequences that have them.
</p>
<p>The command loop sets this variable to <code>nil</code> before each command,
so if a command sets it, the effect applies only to that command.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-global_002ddisable_002dpoint_002dadjustment">Variable: <strong>global-disable-point-adjustment</strong></dt>
<dd><p>If you set this variable to a non-<code>nil</code> value, the feature of
moving point out of these sequences is completely turned off.
</p></dd></dl>
