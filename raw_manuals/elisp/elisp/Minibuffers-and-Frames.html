<span id="Minibuffers-and-Frames-1"></span><h3 class="section">29.9 Minibuffers and Frames</h3>

<p>Normally, each frame has its own minibuffer window at the bottom, which
is used whenever that frame is selected.  You can get that window with
the function <code>minibuffer-window</code> (see <a href="Minibuffer-Windows.html">Minibuffer Windows</a>).
</p>
<span id="index-frame-without-a-minibuffer"></span>
<span id="index-surrogate-minibuffer-frame"></span>
<p>However, you can also create a frame without a minibuffer.  Such a frame
must use the minibuffer window of some other frame.  That other frame
will serve as <em>surrogate minibuffer frame</em> for this frame and cannot
be deleted via <code>delete-frame</code> (see <a href="Deleting-Frames.html">Deleting Frames</a>) as long as
this frame is live.
</p>
<p>When you create the frame, you can explicitly specify its minibuffer
window (in some other frame) with the <code>minibuffer</code> frame parameter
(see <a href="Buffer-Parameters.html">Buffer Parameters</a>).  If you don&rsquo;t, then the minibuffer is found
in the frame which is the value of the variable
<code>default-minibuffer-frame</code>.  Its value should be a frame that does
have a minibuffer.
</p>
<p>If you use a minibuffer-only frame, you might want that frame to raise
when you enter the minibuffer.  If so, set the variable
<code>minibuffer-auto-raise</code> to <code>t</code>.  See <a href="Raising-and-Lowering.html">Raising and Lowering</a>.
</p>
<dl>
<dt id="index-default_002dminibuffer_002dframe">Variable: <strong>default-minibuffer-frame</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This variable specifies the frame to use for the minibuffer window, by
default.  It does not affect existing frames.  It is always local to
the current terminal and cannot be buffer-local.  See <a href="Multiple-Terminals.html">Multiple Terminals</a>.
