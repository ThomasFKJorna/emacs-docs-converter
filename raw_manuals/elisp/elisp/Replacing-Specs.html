<span id="Display-Specs-That-Replace-The-Text"></span><h4 class="subsection">39.16.1 Display Specs That Replace The Text</h4>
<span id="index-replacing-display-specs"></span>

<p>Some kinds of display specifications specify something to display
instead of the text that has the property.  These are called
<em>replacing</em> display specifications.  Emacs does not allow the user
to interactively move point into the middle of buffer text that is
replaced in this way.
</p>
<p>If a list of display specifications includes more than one replacing
display specification, the first overrides the rest.  Replacing
display specifications make most other display specifications
irrelevant, since those don&rsquo;t apply to the replacement.
</p>
<p>For replacing display specifications, <em>the text that has the
property</em> means all the consecutive characters that have the same
Lisp object as their <code>display</code> property; these characters are
replaced as a single unit.  If two characters have different Lisp
objects as their <code>display</code> properties (i.e., objects which are
not <code>eq</code>), they are handled separately.
</p>
<p>Here is an example which illustrates this point.  A string serves as
a replacing display specification, which replaces the text that has
the property with the specified string (see <a href="Other-Display-Specs.html">Other Display Specs</a>).
Consider the following function:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(defun foo ()
  (dotimes (i 5)
    (let ((string (concat &quot;A&quot;))
          (start (+ i i (point-min))))
      (put-text-property start (1+ start) 'display string)
      (put-text-property start (+ 2 start) 'display string))))
</pre></div>

<p>This function gives each of the first ten characters in the buffer a
<code>display</code> property which is a string <code>&quot;A&quot;</code>, but they don&rsquo;t
all get the same string object.  The first two characters get the same
string object, so they are replaced with one &lsquo;<samp>A</samp>&rsquo;; the fact that
the display property was assigned in two separate calls to
<code>put-text-property</code> is irrelevant.  Similarly, the next two
characters get a second string (<code>concat</code> creates a new string
object), so they are replaced with one &lsquo;<samp>A</samp>&rsquo;; and so on.  Thus, the
ten characters appear as five A&rsquo;s.
