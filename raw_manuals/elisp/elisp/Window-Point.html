<span id="index-window-point"></span>
<span id="index-position-in-window"></span>
<span id="index-point-in-window"></span>

<p>Each window has its own value of point (see <a href="Point.html">Point</a>), independent of
the value of point in other windows displaying the same buffer.  This
makes it useful to have multiple windows showing one buffer.
</p>
<ul>
<li> The window point is established when a window is first created; it is
initialized from the buffer&rsquo;s point, or from the window point of another
window opened on the buffer if such a window exists.

</li><li> Selecting a window sets the value of point in its buffer from the
window&rsquo;s value of point.  Conversely, deselecting a window sets the
window&rsquo;s value of point from that of the buffer.  Thus, when you switch
between windows that display a given buffer, the point value for the
selected window is in effect in the buffer, while the point values for
the other windows are stored in those windows.

</li><li> As long as the selected window displays the current buffer, the window&rsquo;s
point and the buffer&rsquo;s point always move together; they remain equal.
</li></ul>

<span id="index-cursor"></span>
<p>Emacs displays the cursor, by default as a rectangular block, in
each window at the position of that window&rsquo;s point.  When the user
switches to another buffer in a window, Emacs moves that window&rsquo;s
cursor to where point is in that buffer.  If the exact position of
point is hidden behind some display element, such as a display string
or an image, Emacs displays the cursor immediately before or after
that display element.
</p>
<dl>
<dt id="index-window_002dpoint">Function: <strong>window-point</strong> <em>&amp;optional window</em></dt>
<dd><p>This function returns the current position of point in <var>window</var>.
For a nonselected window, this is the value point would have (in that
window&rsquo;s buffer) if that window were selected.  The default for
<var>window</var> is the selected window.
</p>
<p>When <var>window</var> is the selected window, the value returned is the
value of point in that window&rsquo;s buffer.  Strictly speaking, it would be
more correct to return the top-level value of point, outside of any
<code>save-excursion</code> forms.  But that value is hard to find.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-set_002dwindow_002dpoint">Function: <strong>set-window-point</strong> <em>window position</em></dt>
<dd><p>This function positions point in <var>window</var> at position
<var>position</var> in <var>window</var>&rsquo;s buffer.  It returns <var>position</var>.
</p>
<p>If <var>window</var> is selected, this simply does <code>goto-char</code> in
<var>window</var>&rsquo;s buffer.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-window_002dpoint_002dinsertion_002dtype">Variable: <strong>window-point-insertion-type</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This variable specifies the marker insertion type (see <a href="Marker-Insertion-Types.html">Marker Insertion Types</a>) of <code>window-point</code>.  The default is <code>nil</code>,
so <code>window-point</code> will stay behind text inserted there.
