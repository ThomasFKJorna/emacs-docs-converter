<span id="Condition-Variables-1"></span><h3 class="section">37.3 Condition Variables</h3>

<p>A <em>condition variable</em> is a way for a thread to block until some
event occurs.  A thread can wait on a condition variable, to be woken
up when some other thread notifies the condition.
</p>
<p>A condition variable is associated with a mutex and, conceptually,
with some condition.  For proper operation, the mutex must be
acquired, and then a waiting thread must loop, testing the condition
and waiting on the condition variable.  For example:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(with-mutex mutex
  (while (not global-variable)
    (condition-wait cond-var)))
</pre></div>

<p>The mutex ensures atomicity, and the loop is for robustness&mdash;there
may be spurious notifications.
</p>
<p>Similarly, the mutex must be held before notifying the condition.
The typical, and best, approach is to acquire the mutex, make the
changes associated with this condition, and then notify it:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(with-mutex mutex
  (setq global-variable (some-computation))
  (condition-notify cond-var))
</pre></div>

<dl>
<dt id="index-make_002dcondition_002dvariable">Function: <strong>make-condition-variable</strong> <em>mutex &amp;optional name</em></dt>
<dd><p>Make a new condition variable associated with <var>mutex</var>.  If
<var>name</var> is specified, it is a name given to the condition variable.
It must be a string.  The name is for debugging purposes only; it has
no meaning to Emacs.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-condition_002dvariable_002dp">Function: <strong>condition-variable-p</strong> <em>object</em></dt>
<dd><p>This function returns <code>t</code> if <var>object</var> represents a condition
variable, <code>nil</code> otherwise.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-condition_002dwait">Function: <strong>condition-wait</strong> <em>cond</em></dt>
<dd><p>Wait for another thread to notify <var>cond</var>, a condition variable.
This function will block until the condition is notified, or until a
signal is delivered to this thread using <code>thread-signal</code>.
</p>
<p>It is an error to call <code>condition-wait</code> without holding the
condition&rsquo;s associated mutex.
</p>
<p><code>condition-wait</code> releases the associated mutex while waiting.
This allows other threads to acquire the mutex in order to notify the
condition.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-condition_002dnotify">Function: <strong>condition-notify</strong> <em>cond &amp;optional all</em></dt>
<dd><p>Notify <var>cond</var>.  The mutex with <var>cond</var> must be held before
calling this.  Ordinarily a single waiting thread is woken by
<code>condition-notify</code>; but if <var>all</var> is not <code>nil</code>, then all
threads waiting on <var>cond</var> are notified.
</p>
<p><code>condition-notify</code> releases the associated mutex while waiting.
This allows other threads to acquire the mutex in order to wait on the
condition.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-condition_002dname">Function: <strong>condition-name</strong> <em>cond</em></dt>
<dd><p>Return the name of <var>cond</var>, as passed to
<code>make-condition-variable</code>.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-condition_002dmutex">Function: <strong>condition-mutex</strong> <em>cond</em></dt>
<dd><p>Return the mutex associated with <var>cond</var>.  Note that the associated
mutex cannot be changed.
</p></dd></dl>
