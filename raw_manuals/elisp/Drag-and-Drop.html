<p>When a user drags something from another application over Emacs, that other
application expects Emacs to tell it if Emacs can handle the data that is
dragged.  The variable <code>x-dnd-test-function</code> is used by Emacs to determine
what to reply.  The default value is <code>x-dnd-default-test-function</code>
which accepts drops if the type of the data to be dropped is present in
<code>x-dnd-known-types</code>.  You can customize <code>x-dnd-test-function</code> and/or
<code>x-dnd-known-types</code> if you want Emacs to accept or reject drops based
on some other criteria.
</p>
<span id="index-x_002ddnd_002dtypes_002dalist"></span>
<p>If you want to change the way Emacs handles drop of different types
or add a new type, customize <code>x-dnd-types-alist</code>.  This requires
detailed knowledge of what types other applications use for drag and
drop.
</p>
<span id="index-dnd_002dprotocol_002dalist"></span>
<p>When an URL is dropped on Emacs it may be a file, but it may also be
another URL type (https, etc.).  Emacs first checks
<code>dnd-protocol-alist</code> to determine what to do with the URL.  If
there is no match there and if <code>browse-url-browser-function</code> is
an alist, Emacs looks for a match there.  If no match is found the
text for the URL is inserted.  If you want to alter Emacs behavior,
you can customize these variables.
