<span id="Window-Configurations-1"></span><h3 class="section">28.26 Window Configurations</h3>
<span id="index-window-configurations"></span>
<span id="index-saving-window-information"></span>

<p>A <em>window configuration</em> records the entire layout of one
frame&mdash;all windows, their sizes, which buffers they contain, how those
buffers are scrolled, and their value of point; also their
fringes, margins, and scroll bar settings.  It also includes the value
of <code>minibuffer-scroll-window</code>.  As a special exception, the window
configuration does not record the value of point in the selected window
for the current buffer.
</p>
<p>You can bring back an entire frame layout by restoring a previously
saved window configuration.  If you want to record the layout of all
frames instead of just one, use a frame configuration instead of a
window configuration.  See <a href="Frame-Configurations.html">Frame Configurations</a>.
</p>
<dl>
<dt id="index-current_002dwindow_002dconfiguration">Function: <strong>current-window-configuration</strong> <em>&amp;optional frame</em></dt>
<dd><p>This function returns a new object representing <var>frame</var>&rsquo;s current
window configuration.  The default for <var>frame</var> is the selected
frame.  The variable <code>window-persistent-parameters</code> specifies
which window parameters (if any) are saved by this function.
See <a href="Window-Parameters.html">Window Parameters</a>.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-set_002dwindow_002dconfiguration">Function: <strong>set-window-configuration</strong> <em>configuration</em></dt>
<dd><p>This function restores the configuration of windows and buffers as
specified by <var>configuration</var>, for the frame that
<var>configuration</var> was created for, regardless of whether that frame
is selected or not.  The argument <var>configuration</var> must be a value
that was previously returned by <code>current-window-configuration</code>
for that frame.
</p>
<p>If the frame from which <var>configuration</var> was saved is dead, all
this function does is to restore the value of the variable
<code>minibuffer-scroll-window</code> and to adjust the value returned by
<code>minibuffer-selected-window</code>.  In this case, the function returns
<code>nil</code>.  Otherwise, it returns <code>t</code>.
</p>
<p>If the buffer of a window of <var>configuration</var> has been killed since
<var>configuration</var> was made, that window is, as a rule, removed from
the restored configuration.  However, if that window is the last
window remaining in the restored configuration, another live buffer is
shown in it.
</p>
<p>Here is a way of using this function to get the same effect as
<code>save-window-excursion</code>:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(let ((config (current-window-configuration)))
  (unwind-protect
      (progn (split-window-below nil)
             &hellip;)
    (set-window-configuration config)))
</pre></div>
</dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-save_002dwindow_002dexcursion">Macro: <strong>save-window-excursion</strong> <em>forms&hellip;</em></dt>
<dd><p>This macro records the window configuration of the selected frame,
executes <var>forms</var> in sequence, then restores the earlier window
configuration.  The return value is the value of the final form in
<var>forms</var>.
</p>
<p>Most Lisp code should not use this macro; <code>save-selected-window</code>
is typically sufficient.  In particular, this macro cannot reliably
prevent the code in <var>forms</var> from opening new windows, because new
windows might be opened in other frames (see <a href="Choosing-Window.html">Choosing Window</a>), and
<code>save-window-excursion</code> only saves and restores the window
configuration on the current frame.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-window_002dconfiguration_002dp">Function: <strong>window-configuration-p</strong> <em>object</em></dt>
<dd><p>This function returns <code>t</code> if <var>object</var> is a window configuration.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-compare_002dwindow_002dconfigurations">Function: <strong>compare-window-configurations</strong> <em>config1 config2</em></dt>
<dd><p>This function compares two window configurations as regards the
structure of windows, but ignores the values of point and the
saved scrolling positions&mdash;it can return <code>t</code> even if those
aspects differ.
</p>
<p>The function <code>equal</code> can also compare two window configurations; it
regards configurations as unequal if they differ in any respect, even a
saved point.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-window_002dconfiguration_002dframe">Function: <strong>window-configuration-frame</strong> <em>config</em></dt>
<dd><p>This function returns the frame for which the window configuration
<var>config</var> was made.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>Other primitives to look inside of window configurations would make
sense, but are not implemented because we did not need them.  See the
file <samp>winner.el</samp> for some more operations on windows
configurations.
</p>
<p>The objects returned by <code>current-window-configuration</code> die
together with the Emacs process.  In order to store a window
configuration on disk and read it back in another Emacs session, you
can use the functions described next.  These functions are also useful
to clone the state of a frame into an arbitrary live window
(<code>set-window-configuration</code> effectively clones the windows of a
frame into the root window of that very frame only).
</p>
<span id="index-window-state"></span>
<dl>
<dt id="index-window_002dstate_002dget">Function: <strong>window-state-get</strong> <em>&amp;optional window writable</em></dt>
<dd><p>This function returns the state of <var>window</var> as a Lisp object.  The
argument <var>window</var> must be a valid window and defaults to the root
window of the selected frame.
</p>
<p>If the optional argument <var>writable</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, this means to
not use markers for sampling positions like <code>window-point</code> or
<code>window-start</code>.  This argument should be non-<code>nil</code> when the
state will be written to disk and read back in another session.
</p>
<p>Together, the argument <var>writable</var> and the variable
<code>window-persistent-parameters</code> specify which window parameters are
saved by this function.  See <a href="Window-Parameters.html">Window Parameters</a>.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>The value returned by <code>window-state-get</code> can be used in the same
session to make a clone of a window in another window.  It can be also
written to disk and read back in another session.  In either case, use
the following function to restore the state of the window.
</p>
<dl>
<dt id="index-window_002dstate_002dput">Function: <strong>window-state-put</strong> <em>state &amp;optional window ignore</em></dt>
<dd><p>This function puts the window state <var>state</var> into <var>window</var>.
The argument <var>state</var> should be the state of a window returned by
an earlier invocation of <code>window-state-get</code>, see above.  The
optional argument <var>window</var> can be either a live window or an
internal window (see <a href="Windows-and-Frames.html">Windows and Frames</a>).  If <var>window</var> is not
a live window, it is replaced by a new live window created on the same
frame before putting <var>state</var> into it.  If <var>window</var> is <code>nil</code>,
it puts the window state into a new window.
</p>
<p>If the optional argument <var>ignore</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, it means to ignore
minimum window sizes and fixed-size restrictions.  If <var>ignore</var>
is <code>safe</code>, this means windows can get as small as one line
and/or two columns.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>The functions <code>window-state-get</code> and <code>window-state-put</code> also
allow to exchange the contents of two live windows.  The following
function does precisely that:
</p>
<dl>
<dt id="index-window_002dswap_002dstates">Command: <strong>window-swap-states</strong> <em>&amp;optional window-1 window-2 size</em></dt>
<dd><p>This command swaps the states of the two live windows <var>window-1</var> and
<var>window-2</var>.  <var>window-1</var> must specify a live window and defaults
to the selected one.  <var>window-2</var> must specify a live window and
defaults to the window following <var>window-1</var> in the cyclic ordering
of windows, excluding minibuffer windows and including live windows on
all visible frames.
</p>
<p>Optional argument <var>size</var> non-<code>nil</code> means to try swapping the
sizes of <var>window-1</var> and <var>window-2</var> as well.  A value of
<code>height</code> means to swap heights only, a value of <code>width</code>
means to swap widths only, while <code>t</code> means to swap both widths
and heights, if possible.  Frames are not resized by this function.
</p></dd></dl>
