<span id="index-button_002ddown-event"></span>

<p>Click and drag events happen when the user releases a mouse button.
They cannot happen earlier, because there is no way to distinguish a
click from a drag until the button is released.
</p>
<p>If you want to take action as soon as a button is pressed, you need to
handle <em>button-down</em> events.<a id="DOCF13" href="#FOOT13"><sup>13</sup></a>  These occur as soon as a button is
pressed.  They are represented by lists that look exactly like click
events (see <a href="Click-Events.html">Click Events</a>), except that the <var>event-type</var> symbol
name contains the prefix &lsquo;<samp>down-</samp>&rsquo;.  The &lsquo;<samp>down-</samp>&rsquo; prefix follows
modifier key prefixes such as &lsquo;<samp>C-</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>M-</samp>&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>The function <code>read-key-sequence</code> ignores any button-down events
that don&rsquo;t have command bindings; therefore, the Emacs command loop
ignores them too.  This means that you need not worry about defining
button-down events unless you want them to do something.  The usual
reason to define a button-down event is so that you can track mouse
motion (by reading motion events) until the button is released.
See <a href="Motion-Events.html">Motion Events</a>.

<p>Button-down is the
conservative antithesis of drag.</p>
