<span id="POSIX-Regular-Expression-Searching"></span><h3 class="section">34.5 POSIX Regular Expression Searching</h3>

<span id="index-backtracking-and-POSIX-regular-expressions"></span>
<p>The usual regular expression functions do backtracking when necessary
to handle the &lsquo;<samp>\|</samp>&rsquo; and repetition constructs, but they continue
this only until they find <em>some</em> match.  Then they succeed and
report the first match found.
</p>
<p>This section describes alternative search functions which perform the
full backtracking specified by the POSIX standard for regular expression
matching.  They continue backtracking until they have tried all
possibilities and found all matches, so they can report the longest
match, as required by POSIX.  This is much slower, so use these
functions only when you really need the longest match.
</p>
<p>The POSIX search and match functions do not properly support the
non-greedy repetition operators (see <a href="Regexp-Special.html">non-greedy</a>).
This is because POSIX backtracking conflicts with the semantics of
non-greedy repetition.
